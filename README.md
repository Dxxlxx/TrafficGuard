This code performs anomaly detection in network traffic data using an Isolation Forest algorithm. It begins by loading a CSV file containing network traffic data, including features like frame.len (packet length) and ip.src (source IP). It then creates additional features, such as traffic_volume (derived from frame.len) and ip_freq (frequency of each source IP). The relevant features are scaled using MinMaxScaler, and the Isolation Forest model is applied to detect anomalies, marking them as either normal (1) or anomalous (-1). The results are visualized using a scatter plot, with anomalies highlighted in red. Logging is used throughout the process to track any errors or important steps.
